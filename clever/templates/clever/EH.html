                <center><h1>Ethical Hacking </h1></center>
<p>Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad discipline, which covers a wide range of topics. The first known event of hacking had taken place in 1960 at MIT and at the same time, the term "Hacker" was originated.</p>
<p>Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exist in a computer system or a computer network and finally entering into them. Hacking is usually done to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the systems or to steal sensitive information available on the computer.</p>
<p>Hacking is usually legal as long as it is being done to find weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call <b>Ethical Hacking</b>.</p>
<p>A computer expert who does the act of hacking is called a "Hacker". Hackers are those who seek knowledge, to understand how systems operate, how they are designed, and then attempt to play with these systems.</p>
<h2>Types of Hacking</h2>
<p>We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here is a set of examples &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Website Hacking</b> &minus; Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Network Hacking</b> &minus; Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Email Hacking</b> &minus; It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Ethical Hacking</b> &minus; Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Password Hacking</b> &minus; This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Computer Hacking</b> &minus; This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of Hacking</h2>
<p>Hacking is quite useful in the following scenarios &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To recover lost information, especially in case you lost your password.</p></li>
<li><p>To perform penetration testing to strengthen computer and network security.</p></li>
<li><p>To put adequate preventative measures in place to prevent security breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>To have a computer system that prevents malicious hackers from gaining access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages of Hacking</h2>
<p>Hacking is quite dangerous if it is done with harmful intent. It can cause &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Massive security breach.</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized system access on private information.</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy violation.</p></li>
<li><p>Hampering system operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Denial of service attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Malicious attack on the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Purpose of Hacking</h2>
<p>There could be various positive and negative intentions behind performing hacking activities. Here is a list of some probable reasons why people indulge in hacking activities &minus;</p>
<h1></h1>
<li>Just for fun</li>
<li>Show-off</li>
<li>Steal important information</li>
<li>Damaging the system</li>
<li>Hampering privacy</li>
<li>Money extortion</li>
<li>System security testing</li>
<li>To break policy compliance</li>

            <div class="p2" style="border:solid 0px;height:2000px;display:none">
                <center><h1>Hacker Types</h1></center>
<p>Hackers can be classified into different categories such as white hat, black hat, and grey hat, based on their intent of hacking a system. These different terms come from old Spaghetti Westerns, where the bad guy wears a black cowboy hat and the good guy wears a white hat.</p>
<h2>White Hat Hackers</h2>
<p>White Hat hackers are also known as <b>Ethical Hackers</b>. They never intent to harm a system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer or a network system as a part of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.</p>
<p>Ethical hacking is not illegal and it is one of the demanding jobs available in the IT industry. There are numerous companies that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.</p>
<h2>Black Hat Hackers</h2>
<p>Black Hat hackers, also known as <b>crackers</b>, are those who hack in order to gain unauthorized access to a system and harm its operations or steal sensitive information.</p>
<p>Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad intent which includes stealing corporate data, violating privacy, damaging the system, blocking network communication, etc.</p>
<h2>Grey Hat Hackers</h2>
<p>Grey hat hackers are a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They act without malicious intent but for their fun, they exploit a security weakness in a computer system or network without the ownerâ€™s permission or knowledge.</p>
<p>Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the owners and getting appreciation or a little bounty from the owners.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous Hackers</h2>
<p>Apart from the above well-known classes of hackers, we have the following categories of hackers based on what they hack and how they do it &minus;</p>
<h3>Red Hat Hackers</h3>
<p>Red hat hackers are again a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They are usually on the level of hacking government agencies, top-secret information hubs, and generally anything that falls under the category of sensitive information.</p>
<h3>Blue Hat Hackers</h3>
<p>A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who is used to bug-test a system prior to its launch. They look for loopholes that can be exploited and try to close these gaps. Microsoft also uses the term <b>BlueHat</b> to represent a series of security briefing events.</p>
<h3>Elite Hackers</h3>
<p>This is a social status among hackers, which is used to describe the most skilled. Newly discovered exploits will circulate among these hackers.</p>
<h3>Script Kiddie</h3>
<p>A script kiddie is a non-expert who breaks into computer systems by using pre-packaged automated tools written by others, usually with little understanding of the underlying concept, hence the term <b>Kiddie</b>.</p>
<h3>Neophyte</h3>
<p>A neophyte, "n00b", or "newbie" or "Green Hat Hacker" is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking.</p>
<h3>Hacktivist</h3>
<p>A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to announce a social, ideological, religious, or political message. In general, most hacktivism involves website defacement or denialof-service attacks.</p>

<li>SQL injection</li>

<p>In this chapter, we will discuss some of the skills that you would require to become an expert in Ethical Hacking.</p>
<h2>Basic Skills</h2>
<p>Computer Hacking is a Science as well as an Art. Like any other expertise, you need to put a lot of effort in order to acquire knowledge and become an expert hacker. Once you are on the track, you would need more effort to keep up-to-date with latest technologies, new vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An ethical hacker must be a computer systems expert and needs to have very strong programming and computer networking skills.</p></li>
<li><p>An ethical hacker needs to have a lot of patience, persistence, and perseverance to try again and again and wait for the required result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, an ethical hacker should be smart enough to understand the situation and other usersâ€™ mind-set in order to apply social engineering exploits. A good ethical hacker has great problem-solving skills too.</p>
<h2>Courses &amp; Certifications</h2>
<p>This tutorial provides the basic guidelines to become a successful Ethical Hacker. If you want to excel in this field, then you might choose to pursue the following courses and certifications &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Obtain a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science or A+ Certificate to gain an understanding of the most common hardware and software technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Get into a programmerâ€™s role for a few years and then switch to get a tech support position.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to get network certifications like Network+ or CCNA and then security certifications like Security+, CISSP, or TICSA.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that you get some work experience as a Network Engineer and System Administrator to understand networks and systems inside out.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep going through various books, tutorials and papers to understand various computer security aspects and take them as a challenge to secure your network and computer systems as network security engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>Study courses which cover creating Trojan horses, backdoors, viruses, and worms, denial of service (DoS) attacks, SQL injection, buffer overflow, session hijacking, and system hacking.</p></li>
<li><p>Master the art of penetration testing, footprinting and reconnaissance, and social engineering.</p></li>

<h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>Reconnaissance is the phase where the attacker gathers information about a target using active or passive means. The tools that are widely used in this process are NMAP, Hping, Maltego, and Google Dorks.</p>
<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>In this process, the attacker begins to actively probe a target machine or network for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The tools used in this process are Nessus, Nexpose, and NMAP.</p>
<h2>Gaining Access</h2>
<p>In this process, the vulnerability is located and you attempt to exploit it in order to enter into the system. The primary tool that is used in this process is Metasploit.</p>
<h2>Maintaining Access</h2>
<p>It is the process where the hacker has already gained access into a system. After gaining access, the hacker installs some backdoors in order to enter into the system when he needs access in this owned system in future. Metasploit is the preferred tool in this process.</p>
<h2>Clearing Tracks</h2>
<p>This process is actually an unethical activity. It has to do with the deletion of logs of all the activities that take place during the hacking process.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>Reporting is the last step of finishing the ethical hacking process. Here the Ethical Hacker compiles a report with his findings and the job that was done such as the tools used, the success rate, vulnerabilities found, and the exploit processes.</p>
<h2>Quick Tip</h2>
<p>The processes are not standard. You can adopt a set of different processes and tools according to your techniques that you are comfortable with. The process is of least significance as long as you are able to get the desired results.</p>

                <center><h1>Ethical Hacking - Reconnaissance</h1></center>
<p>Information Gathering and getting to know the target systems is the first process in ethical hacking. Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning &amp; Enumeration) used to covertly discover and collect information about a target system.</p>
<p>During reconnaissance, an ethical hacker attempts to gather as much information about a target system as possible, following the seven steps listed below &minus;</p>
<h1></h1>
<li>Gather initial information</li>
<li>Determine the network range</li>
<li>Identify active machines</li>
<li>Discover open ports and access points</li>
<li>Fingerprint the operating system</li>
<li>Uncover services on ports</li>
<li>Map the network</li>
<p>We will discuss in detail all these steps in the subsequent chapters of this tutorial. Reconnaissance takes place in two parts &minus; <b>Active Reconnaissance</b> and <b>Passive Reconnaissance</b>.</p>
<h2>Active Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>In this process, you will directly interact with the computer system to gain information. This information can be relevant and accurate. But there is a risk of getting detected if you are planning active reconnaissance without permission. If you are detected, then system admin can take severe action against you and trail your subsequent activities.</p>
<h2>Passive Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>In this process, you will not be directly connected to a computer system. This process is used to gather essential information without ever interacting with the target systems.</p>
